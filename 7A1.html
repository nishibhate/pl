        <p>Regarded and revered as one of the fifty-one Shakti Peeths, Naina Devi Temple is one of the most renowned places of Hindu worship all over the country. The presiding deity of the Naina Devi Temple is Maa Naina Devi or Mata Sati. It is believed to have been built on the spot where Goddess Sati's eyes fell on Earth.</p>
        <h3></h3>
        <p>3 km off Nainital, Snow View offers an expansive and majestic view of the Himalayas. It also houses a quaint little local temple. You can take either the cable car, taxi or a trek up the undulating slopes.</p>

            Nainital is located in the Kumaon foothills of the outer Himalayas at a distance of 285 km (177 mi) from the state capital Dehradun and 345 km (214 mi) from New Delhi, the capital of India. Situated at an altitude of 1,938 metres (6,358 ft) above sea level, the city is set in a valley containing an eye-shaped lake, approximately two miles in circumference, and surrounded by mountains, of which the highest are Naina Peak (2,615 m (8,579 ft)) on the north, Deopatha (2,438 m (7,999 ft)) on the west, and Ayarpatha (2,278 m (7,474 ft)) on the south. From the tops of the higher peaks, "magnificent views can be obtained of the vast plain to the south, or of the mass of tangled ridges lying north, bound by the great snowy range which forms the central axis of the Himalayas." The hill station attracts tourists round the year.</p>
